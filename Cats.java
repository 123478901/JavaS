public class Cats 
{
    String pattern = "Striped"; String colour = " is orange";
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Cats kitten = new Cats();
        Cats tiger= new Cats();
        System.out.println(kitten.pattern);
        System.out.println( tiger.colour);
    }
}

// add another class with tiger maybe and code that and from there also see what public static method I will put, also my main could maybe go to my cats then I have a differnt method for kitten so that I don't have to worry even if I comment it out.
